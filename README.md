#ROAD iOS Framework

A set of reusable components taking advantage of extra dimension [Attribute-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-oriented_programming) adds.

##Components

**Core** - support for attributes, reflection and helper-extensions on Foundation classes.  
**Services** - implementation of Service Locator pattern, centralized replacement for singletons.  
**Serialization** - attribute-based JSON and XML parsers for easy DOM (de)serializations.  
**Web Services** - attribute-based HTTP client API.  
**Logger** - attribute-based logger.  
**Observation** - unification of KVO and NSNotifications with block-based callbacks.

##Requirements

ROAD requires **iOS 5.0** and above. Compatibility with **4.3** and older is not tested.

ROAD initially designed to use **ARC**. 

##Jump Start
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) the only recommended way of ROAD integration. Besides standard configuration of pod dependencies pod_install hook definition required as shown below. Typical Podfile will looks like following:

	platform :ios, '5.0'

	pod 'ROADFramework', '~> 1.1.0'

	post_install do |installer|
	  require File.expand_path('./', 'ROADConfigurator.rb')
	  ROADConfigurator::post_install(installer)
	end


Download [`ROADConfigurator.rb`](./Cocoapods/Podfile) and put it right near your `Podfile`

**Using components separately**  
If you'd like to embed only specific components from the framework it can be done with CocoaPods as well.

        pod 'spark-ios-framework/ROADServices'
        pod 'spark-ios-framework/ROADWebService'

Detail information on internals of ROAD integration as well as advanced topics like integration with predefined workspace, multiple projects or targets available in [documentation](./Documents/Configuration/Cocoapods.md).
